# Requiriments
- Install mysql database
- Install python3.9.*
- Install flask and flask-mysqldb

*To download flask*

pip install flask flask-mysqldb

*To database on mysql. You can install mysql or mariadb*
*In my case. I have used mariadb as my database, but you can* 
*install mysql or mariadb*
*the important is that you had created database which found in folder*
*"database" called "contacts_app.sql"*

*But we still not have configurated the connection between flask and*
*database. To do this, go to folder "public/routes/mysqldb.py" and*
*configured parameters of the connection*
